== Creating new rules
You can create rules for Microsoft Exchange Online and Microsoft OneDrive for Business.  Rules for Microsoft Exchange Online are applied before rules for Microsoft OneDrive for Business.  You cannot create rules for Microsoft SharePoint Online.

You must apply a user defined filter to your data before you can create a rule.  Applied filters are displayed below the *Filter* icon.  NetApp SaaS Backup for Office 365 default filters appear in gray.  User defined filters appear in light blue.
