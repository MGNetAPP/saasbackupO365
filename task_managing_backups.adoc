After you have completed the setup process for NetApp SaaS Backup (formerly "NetApp Cloud Control"), you can use SaaS Backup for Office 365 to manage backups of Microsoft Exchange Online, Microsoft OneDrive for Business, and Microsoft SharePoint Online.

== Backup policies
SaaS Backup for Office 365 has three predefined tiers of backup policies.  These policy tiers vary in backup frequency and data retention period, depending upon whether you are using SaaS Backup provided storage or BYOS.

You can move data between the three policies, but you cannot create new policies or change the parameters of the predefined tiers.

=== Backup policies for SaaS Backup provided storage

[options="header" width="80%"]
|=======
|Backup policy |Backup frequency |Default data retention period
|Tier 1 |Once every 12 hours |3 years
|Tier 2 |Once every 18 hours |3 years
|Tier 3 |Once every 24 hours |3 years
|=======

=== Backup policies for BYOS

[options="header" width="80%"]

|Backup policy |Backup frequency |Default data retention period
|Tier 1 |Once every 12 hours |Forever
|Tier 2 |Once every 18 hours |Forever
|Tier 3 |Once every 24 hours |Forever

== Scheduling a backup or changing backup frequency
You can back up your unprotected data by assigning it to a backup policy. When unprotected data is assigned to a backup policy, it moves to a *PENDING* state until the next scheduled backup for the assigned policy occurs, after which it is moved to a *PROTECTED* state.
If you want to change the backup frequency of protected data, you can assign the data to a different backup policy tier.

.Steps

. From the Dashboard, click the number above *PROTECTED* or *UNPROTECTED* in the box of the service you want to change.
  If you want to change the backup frequency of protected data, click *PROTECTED*. If you want to backup newly discovered mailboxes, sites, or MySites, select *UNPROTECTED*.
