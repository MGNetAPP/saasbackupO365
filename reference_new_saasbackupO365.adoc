After your automatic service account is created, your shared mailboxes will be automatically discovered during the next scheduled synchronization of your user account.  If you want your shared mailboxes discovered immediately, you can <<task_discovering_new.adoc#sdiscovering-new-mailboxes-sites-and-groups,discover your user accounts immediately>>.
